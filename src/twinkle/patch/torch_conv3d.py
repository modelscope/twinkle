"""Work around a broken ``nn.Conv3d`` on torch 2.9.x by reimplementing it as unfold + linear.

torch 2.9.x (2.9.0 <= version < 2.10.0) has a defective ``nn.Conv3d.forward`` for the
non-overlapping patch-embedding case used by video/3D ViT patch embeds. This patch replaces
``nn.Conv3d.forward`` with a mathematically equivalent unfold + ``F.linear`` implementation, but only
for the exact configuration patch embeds use: ``stride == kernel_size``, ``padding == 0``,
``dilation == 1``, ``groups == 1``. Any other configuration raises ``NotImplementedError`` rather than
silently returning wrong results.

The replacement is global (class-level on ``nn.Conv3d``) and version-gated: outside 2.9.x
``__call__`` is a no-op, so it is always safe to apply. It mirrors legacy swift's ``_patch_conv3d``
(swift/model/utils.py), which is applied unconditionally at import under the same version guard.

Usage (persistent, like other global patches)::

    from twinkle.patch import apply_patch
    from twinkle.patch.torch_conv3d import TorchConv3dPatch
    apply_patch(None, TorchConv3dPatch())
